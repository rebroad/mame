# Star Wars ROM to C++ Conversion

This project converts the classic Atari Star Wars arcade game from 6809 assembly code to modern C++, based on comprehensive analysis of the original ROM files and MAME emulation source code.

## Overview

The Star Wars arcade game (1983) was built on custom Atari hardware featuring:
- **Dual Motorola 6809E CPUs** (main and audio)
- **Custom Mathbox** (matrix processor for 3D calculations)
- **AVG Vector Generator** (custom vector graphics processor)
- **POKEY and TMS5220** sound chips
- **X2212 NVRAM** for high scores

This conversion aims to create a high-performance, maintainable version that runs natively on modern hardware while preserving the original game's behavior and feel.

- **Make** or **Ninja** build system

### Optional Dependencies
- **OpenGL** (for graphics rendering)
- **SDL2** (for windowing and input)
- **Threading** (for parallel processing)

### Build Instructions

```bash
# Clone or download the project
cd starwars_cpp

# Create build directory
mkdir build
cd build

# Configure with CMake
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

# Build the project
make -j$(nproc)

# Run the executable
./bin/starwars_cpp
```

### Build Options

```bash
# Enable OpenGL support
cmake .. -DENABLE_OPENGL=ON

# Enable SDL2 support
cmake .. -DENABLE_SDL2=ON

# Enable threading support
cmake .. -DENABLE_THREADING=ON

cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```cpp
#include "starwars.h"

int main() {
    auto starwars = std::make_unique<StarWars::StarWarsHardware>();
    
    if (starwars->init()) {
        starwars->run();
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Advanced Usage
```cpp
#include "starwars.h"

int main() {
    auto starwars = std::make_unique<StarWars::StarWarsHardware>();
    
    if (starwars->init()) {
        // Custom game loop
        while (running) {
            starwars->update();
            starwars->render();
