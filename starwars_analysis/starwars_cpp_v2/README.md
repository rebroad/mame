# Star Wars Arcade - Native C++ Implementation (Round 2)

## 🚀 **Fresh Start with Correct Foundation**

This is a **completely new implementation** based on **validated disassembly** and **verified hardware knowledge**. We've learned from our mistakes and are building on solid ground this time!

## ✅ **What We Know is Correct**

### **Hardware Architecture (Verified)**
- **Dual Motorola 6809E CPUs** - Main and audio processors
- **Custom Mathbox** - 3D matrix processor with PROM microcode
- **AVG Vector Generator** - Custom vector graphics processor  
- **POKEY and TMS5220** - Sound chips
- **X2212 NVRAM** - High score storage

### **Memory Map (Verified from MAME)**
```
0x0000-0x2FFF: RAM (12KB) - Main CPU RAM
0x3000-0x3FFF: Vector ROM (4KB) - AVG vector graphics data
0x4300-0x431F: Input Port 0 - Coin, service, buttons
0x4320-0x433F: Input Port 1 - Additional controls, VG_HALT, MATH_RUN
0x4340-0x435F: DSW0 - Game settings (shields, difficulty, etc.)
0x4360-0x437F: DSW1 - Coinage settings
0x4380-0x439F: ADC - Analog stick inputs
0x4400-0x4400: Sound latch (write)
0x4400-0x4400: Main latch (read)
0x4401-0x4401: Ready flags
0x4500-0x45FF: NVRAM (X2212)
0x4600-0x461F: AVG GO command
0x4620-0x463F: AVG RESET command
0x4640-0x465F: Watchdog reset
0x4660-0x467F: IRQ acknowledge
0x4680-0x4687: Output latch (LEDs, counters, banking)
0x46A0-0x46BF: NVRAM store
0x46C0-0x46C3: ADC start
0x46E0-0x46E0: Sound CPU reset
0x4700-0x4707: Mathbox registers
0x4800-0x4FFF: CPU and Math RAM
0x5000-0x5FFF: Math RAM (shared)
0x6000-0x7FFF: Banked ROM (main game code)
0x8000-0xFFFF: Main ROM (additional code)
```

### **I/O Port Addresses (Verified from MAME Traces)**
- **0x5022, 0x5023, 0x5024, 0x5025** - PA/PB ports we traced
- **0x4600** - AVG_GO command (we saw this in traces)
- **0x4700, 0x4701** - Mathbox registers (we traced these)

### **Real Routine Addresses (Validated)**
- **0xA261** - Real main game loop (ROM offset 0x5261)
- **0xF261** - Memory-mapped entry point that all addresses jump to
- **Memory mapping** - ROM file offsets ≠ 6809 memory addresses

## 🏗️ **Current Implementation**

### **Core Hardware Class**
- **`StarWarsHardware`** - Main hardware abstraction layer
- **Memory management** - Accurate 6809 memory map
- **I/O system** - Verified port addresses and behavior
- **ROM loading** - Proper file handling and mapping

### **Build System**
- **CMake** - Modern C++17 build system
- **Cross-platform** - Linux, Windows, macOS support
- **ROM integration** - Automatic ROM file copying

## 🔧 **Building**

### **Prerequisites**
- **C++17** compatible compiler (GCC 7+, Clang 5+, MSVC 2017+)
- **CMake** 3.16 or later
- **Make** or **Ninja** build system

### **Build Instructions**
```bash
# Create build directory
mkdir build
cd build

# Configure with CMake
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

# Build the project
make -j$(nproc)

# Run the executable
./bin/starwars_cpp
```

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

### **Phase 1: Core System (Current)**
- [x] Hardware abstraction layer
- [x] Memory management system
- [x] I/O port handling
- [x] ROM loading and mapping

### **Phase 2: ROM Routine Implementation**
- [ ] Implement validated routines from disassembly
- [ ] Create proper 6809 CPU simulation
- [ ] Add instruction execution engine
- [ ] Implement memory-mapped address translation

### **Phase 3: Hardware Components**
- [ ] Mathbox implementation (with PROM microcode)
- [ ] AVG vector generator
- [ ] Input system
- [ ] Sound system (POKEY, TMS5220)

### **Phase 4: Game Logic**
- [ ] Main game loop
- [ ] State management
- [ ] Object system
- [ ] Physics simulation

### **Phase 5: Graphics and Audio**
- [ ] Vector graphics rendering
- [ ] Sound effects and music
- [ ] Modern graphics API integration
- [ ] High-resolution rendering

## 🚫 **What We Discarded from Round 1**

### **Faulty Information**
- **Wrong ROM analysis** - "182 strings", "69 jump table entries" were from corrupted data
- **Incorrect routine addresses** - 611E, CD9E, CDC3 were memory-mapped, not ROM offsets
- **Bad disassembly** - Based on corrupted `complete_memory_map.bin`
- **False trace matching** - Hardware writes matched, but ROM execution was wrong

### **Lessons Learned**
- **Always validate disassembly** - Use automated tools to check routine boundaries
- **Understand memory mapping** - ROM file offsets ≠ 6809 memory addresses
- **Verify trace data** - Hardware writes ≠ ROM routine execution
- **Test incrementally** - Build and test small pieces at a time

## 🔍 **Validation Approach**

### **Automated Tools**
- **`validate_disassembly.py`** - Checks routine completeness and structure
- **`automated_disassembler.py`** - Finds and disassembles routines automatically
- **Boundary detection** - Intelligent analysis of routine boundaries

### **Verification Methods**
- **MAME trace comparison** - Hardware I/O verification
- **ROM disassembly** - Actual code analysis
- **Memory mapping** - Address translation verification
- **Incremental testing** - Build and test each component

## 📊 **Current Status**

## 📝 **Notes**

This implementation is built on **solid foundation** with **verified data**. We've learned from our mistakes and are using **automated tools** to ensure accuracy. The goal is to create a **high-performance, maintainable** version that preserves the original game's behavior while enabling modern enhancements.

**May the Force be with you!** ⭐
